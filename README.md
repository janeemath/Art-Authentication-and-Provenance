# Decentralized Art Authentication and Provenance System

A blockchain-based platform for verifying artwork authenticity, tracking provenance, and managing ownership rights through smart contracts. The system provides a transparent and immutable record of artwork history while enabling fractional ownership opportunities.

## System Architecture

### Artwork Registration Contract
Manages the initial recording and documentation of artworks:
- Digital fingerprint creation
- Artwork metadata storage
- Physical characteristics documentation
- Artist verification
- Creation date recording
- Medium and materials documentation
- High-resolution image storage
- Technical specifications

### Authentication Contract
Handles the verification process for artworks:
- Expert validator management
- Multi-signature authentication
- Physical inspection coordination
- Technical analysis recording
- Authentication certificate issuance
- Fraud detection mechanisms
- Verification history tracking
- Dispute resolution

### Provenance Contract
Maintains the complete ownership history:
- Transfer recordings
- Exhibition history
- Restoration records
- Location tracking
- Transaction verification
- Historical value tracking
- Market event documentation
- Owner privacy protection

### Fractional Ownership Contract
Enables partial ownership of valuable artworks:
- Token issuance and management
- Ownership share tracking
- Dividend distribution
- Voting rights management
- Secondary market facilitation
- Share transfer processing
- Value appreciation tracking
- Liquidity pool management

## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js >= 16.0.0
Hardhat
IPFS node
Web3 wallet
Hardware security module (recommended)
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/art-authentication.git
cd art-authentication
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Configure required variables:
# - IPFS_NODE_URL
# - VALIDATOR_KEYS
# - STORAGE_API_KEY
# - SECURITY_PARAMS
```

4. Deploy smart contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## Usage Examples

### Register New Artwork

```solidity
await ArtworkRegistrationContract.registerArtwork({
    title: "Sunset in Venice",
    artist: "Jane Smith",
    creationDate: "2024",
    medium: "Oil on canvas",
    dimensions: {
        height: 100,
        width: 80,
        unit: "cm"
    },
    digitalFingerprint: "0x...",
    ipfsHash: "Qm..."
});
```

### Initiate Authentication Process

```solidity
await AuthenticationContract.initiateVerification({
    artworkId: "ART-123",
    validators: [
        "0xValidator1...",
        "0xValidator2...",
        "0xValidator3..."
    ],
    inspectionDetails: {
        location: "Paris",
        datetime: "2025-03-15T10:00:00Z",
        requirements: ["UV Analysis", "X-Ray", "Material Testing"]
    }
});
```

### Record Ownership Transfer

```solidity
await ProvenanceContract.recordTransfer({
    artworkId: "ART-123",
    fromAddress: "0xSeller...",
    toAddress: "0xBuyer...",
    transactionDate: Date.now(),
    salePrice: ethers.utils.parseEther("100"),
    documentationHash: "Qm..."
});
```

### Create Fractional Shares

```solidity
await FractionalOwnershipContract.tokenize({
    artworkId: "ART-123",
    totalShares: 1000,
    initialPrice: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"),
    minimumHoldingPeriod: 2592000, // 30 days
    votingRights: true
});
```

## Security Measures

- Multi-signature authentication requirements
- Hardware security module integration
- Encrypted metadata storage
- Biometric verification options
- Regular security audits
- Anti-fraud mechanisms
- Access control management
- Backup and recovery protocols

## IPFS Integration

### Artwork Documentation Storage
```javascript
class IPFSStorage {
    async storeArtworkData(artwork) {
        const ipfsHash = await this.uploadToIPFS(artwork);
        await ArtworkRegistrationContract.updateIPFSHash(ipfsHash);
    }
}
```

## Testing

Execute test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

## API Documentation

### Artwork Management
